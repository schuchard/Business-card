# Virtual Business Card - LinkedIn
### How does this work?
This application authenticates in a user with their LinkedIn username and password and creates an account. Then the user can build a virtual business card with the most current profile information from LinkedIn. Users have the option to edit and save the card to their account on this site, not back to LinkedIn. No changes are made to your LinkedIn account. Once saved the user can share the URL. The user can create as many cards as they want and delete ones they no longer use.

### What's under the hood?
This web app was built with Mongo, Express, Angular and Node. Also used for user authentication is [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer).
